# 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid

You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colours: **Red**, **Yellow** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same colour (i.e no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same colour).

You are given `n` the number of rows of the grid.

Return *the number of ways* you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 54
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 246
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 106494
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `grid[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`

**Key Note**:

1. There are only two possibilities to form a non-adjacent row: **3 colors combination** (use all three colors, e.g., RYG) and **2 color combination** (use only two of three colors, e.g., RYR).
2. We add the new row one by one. Apart from its inner adjacent relation, **every new added row only relies on the previous one row** (new added row is only adjacent with the row above it).
3. **Every color combination follows the same pattern indicated below**. 3-color combination can generate **two** 3-color combination, and **two** 2-color combination for the next round. 2-color combination can generate **two** 3-color combination, and **three** 2-color combination for the next round.

Let's try to have a math eqution to show the change above.
The number of 3-color combination for round n is: **S(n)**. The number of 2-color combination for round n is **T(n**).
Thus, we can have two simple math equations reflecting the relation between current round (n) with next round (n + 1) for both 3-color-combination and 2-color-combination.

**S(n + 1) = 2 \* S(n) + 2 \* T(n)**
**T(n + 1) = 2 \* S(n) + 3 \* T(n)**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        long mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long a121 = 6;
        long a123 = 6;
        long b121, b123;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            b121 = (3 * a121 + 2 * a123) % mod;
            b123 = (2 * a121 + 2 * a123) % mod;
            a121 = b121;
            a123 = b123;
        }
        return (a121 + a123) % mod;
    }
};
```
