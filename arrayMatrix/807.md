# 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline

Medium

In a 2 dimensional array `grid`, each value `grid[i][j]` represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. 

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See the following example.

What is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?

```
Example:
Input: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]
Output: 35
Explanation: 
The grid is:
[ [3, 0, 8, 4], 
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]

The skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]
The skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]

The grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:

gridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],
            [7, 4, 7, 7],
            [9, 4, 8, 7],
            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]

```

**Notes:** 

- `1 < grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50`.
- All heights `grid[i][j]` are in the range `[0, 100]`.
- All buildings in `grid[i][j]` occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a `1 x 1 x grid[i][j]` rectangular prism.



# Version 1

题目的意思就是每个位置所取的值不能比他所处行列的最大值大。

很暴力的做法

maxiarray存储每一行的最大值

maxjarray存储每一列的最大值

maxMatrix存储每一个位置能够取的最大值

maxMatrix-grid就是结构了

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int maxi = grid.size();
        int maxj = grid[0].size();
        int maxMatrix[maxi][maxj] = {0};
        
        int maxiarray[maxi] = {0};
        int maxjarray[maxj] = {0};
        
      	//求出每一行的最大值，存到maxiarray
        for(int i = 0; i < maxi; i++) {
            int max = -0xffff;
            for(int j = 0; j < maxj; j++) {
                if(grid[i][j] > max) 
                    max = grid[i][j];
            }
            maxiarray[i] = max;
        }
        //求出每一列最大值，存到maxjarray
        for(int j = 0; j < maxj; j++) {
            int max = -0xffff;
            for(int i = 0; i < maxi; i++ ) {
                if(grid[i][j] > max)
                    max = grid[i][j];
            }
            maxjarray[j] = max;
        }
        //求出每个位置可以存放的最大值，存到maxMatrix
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < maxi; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < maxj; j++) {
                maxMatrix[i][j] = min(maxiarray[i], maxjarray[j]);
                res += maxMatrix[i][j] - grid[i][j];
            }
        }
      
      return  res;
    }
};
```
