# 1004.Counting Leaves

A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0<*N*<100, the number of nodes in a tree, and *M* (<*N*), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then *M* lines follow, each in the format:

```
ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
```

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `01`.

The input ends with *N* being 0. That case must NOT be processed.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child **for every seniority level** starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.

The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where `01` is the root and `02` is its only child. Hence on the root `01` level, there is `0` leaf node; and on the next level, there is `1` leaf node. Then we should output `0 1` in a line.

Sample Input:

```in
2 1
01 1 02
```

Sample Output:

```out
0 1
```



# Version1

DFS

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
const int maxn = 105;
vector<int> children[maxn];	//children[i]表示节点i的孩子vector
int nodeHeight[maxn];		//nodeHeight[i]表示height为i的leaf node的数量

int maxHeight = 0;

void dfs(int index, int height) {
    maxHeight = max(height, maxHeight); //更新max height
    
    if(children[index].size() == 0) {
        nodeHeight[height]++;	//更新高度为height的leaf数量
        return;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < children[index].size(); i++) { //递归访问
        dfs(children[index][i], height + 1);
    }
}
int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    int id, childNum;
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        cin >> id >> childNum;
        int childrenID;
        for(int i = 0; i < childNum; i++) {
            cin >> childrenID;
            children[id].push_back(childrenID);
        }
    }
    dfs(1, 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= maxHeight; i++) {
        cout << nodeHeight[i];
        if(i != maxHeight) cout << " ";
    }   
}
```
