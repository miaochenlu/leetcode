# 684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected** graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[u, v]` with `u < v`, that represents an **undirected**edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge `[u, v]` should be in the same format, with `u < v`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```



**Note:**

The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.

Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.



**Update (2017-09-26):**
We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an ***undirected\*** graph. For the ***directed\***graph follow up please see **[Redundant Connection II](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/description/)**). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

用Union Find来解决这个问题，要去掉的那条边就是在做union的时候father相同的两个顶点连的边

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int n, count;
    vector<int> father;
    vector<int> res;
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        n = edges.size();
        count = n;
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            father.push_back(i);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++)
            Union(edges[i][0], edges[i][1]);
        return res;
    }
    
    int findFather(int x) {
        if(x == father[x]) return x;
        else {
            int z = x;
            while(x != father[x]) 
                x = father[x];
            while(z != father[z]) {
                int tmp = father[z];
                father[z] = x;
                z = tmp;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
    
    void Union(int a, int b) {
        int faA = findFather(a);
        int faB = findFather(b);
        if(faA == faB) {
            res.clear();
            res.push_back(a);
            res.push_back(b);
        } else {
            father[faA] = faB;
        }
    }
};
```

注意这块: 这里决定了要去掉哪条边

```cpp
if(faA == faB) {
  res.clear();
  res.push_back(a);
  res.push_back(b);
} 
```
